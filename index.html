                <p>
                    I am an alumnus of <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>
                    where I majored in <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/undergraduate/bba/academics/majors/science-and-tech-mgmt/">Science and Technology Management</a>, 
                    a unique hybrid degree that allowed me to specialize
                    in both business and engineering,
                    with a minor in Management Information Systems. You can find my resume linked here [TBD}.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After my internship with the company and my graduation in May 2021, I have been working at <a href = "https://www.google.com/">Google</a> as an Associate Finance Analyst 
                    participating in a 2 year rotational program for early career professionals.
                    I have rotated through Chrome doing financial reporting, strategy and operations for Google Cloud, 
                    and am now doing data engineering for our global revenue accounting team. I aim to continue growing
                    my technical skills in this program and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My academic background and experiences demonstrate my diverse set of skills and interests 
                    ranging from operations and project management, financial modeling/strategy, data analysis, 
                    DE&I initiatives, sustainability consulting, coding, the applications of mechanical systems, 
                    and the engineering design process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I learn! I have been a classically trained saxophonist for the past 13 years 
                    (with no plans to stop anytime soon), and have begun to experiment with digital music production 
                    and composition. I love to travel and game as well. With gaming, I am a fan of both battle royales and story-driven narratives.
                    And with travel, I hope to visit every continent within the next few years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am from the US-Mexico border and pride myself as being a child of immigrants. My parents,
                    aka my greatest role models, instilled in me tenacity and a love of learning which I apply in every 
                    aspect of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently live in Austin, TX and enjoy exploring the amazing restaurants in the city.
