                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    A kid from the US/Mexico border and proud son of an immigrant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>
                    where I majored in <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-programs/bba/academics/majors/science-tech-management-major/">Science and Technology Management</a>, 
                    a unique hybrid degree that allowed me to specialize
                    in both supply chain management and mechanical engineering,
                    with a minor in management information systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been a drummer since I was a kid and have studied the saxophone for 15+ years.
                    <br>
                    I enjoy watching Formula 1, reading fiction, watching movies and taking about the soundtrack, and collecting stationery.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently live in Austin, TX.
